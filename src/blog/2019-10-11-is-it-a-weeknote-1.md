[Hurrell](https://mhurrell.co.uk/prospects/)’s writing weeknotes and they’re so damn good that I thought I’d try too.

*   got back from Buenos Aires on Monday morning. I didn’t sleep very well on the plane and after an hour’s nap, left the house at about 11am and tried to spend the rest of the day outdoors / not asleep on the sofa. gentle breast stroke = great for exhaustion / jetlag, but honestly, go before 3.30 because you wanna be swimming with old people, not primary school kids.
*   also didn’t sleep well on Monday night, so spent Tuesday being basically horrible to all my colleagues. sorry! I’ll take an extra day off next time I travel across the ocean!
*   spent Saturday last week \[still counts as part of this week, surely?\] walking around BA - had a steak sandwich, went to Recoleta cemetery and took a photo of a boxer’s grave (I thought the statue was of a man in a dressing gown, but no, a boxer), and went to [MALBA](https://malba.org.ar/en/). MALBA was great, the Leandro Erlich exhibition had loads of people laughing and taking photos which is nice isn’t it? and then the permanent exhibition was great too. turns out I know nothing about Latin American art and very little history, so it was great to fill some gaps.
*   the best thing about working from home is flipping my laptop’s sound output to my airport express, which connects to my amp which connects to my speakers. I got an amp, CD player and my dad’s old speakers for my sixteenth birthday and they are still the best things I own, probably. (on reflection: alongside a frying pan [Dina](https://www.twitter.com/dinarickman) got me for a combined Hanukkah and Christmas present more than a decade ago)
*   Coleen Rooney as a PI has been the best thing to happen all week. I was lucky enough to chat to someone on the fraud team on Verify about it around about the time that the story broke. “HUMINT followed by SOCINT” he said: human intelligence followed by social media intelligence. pretty much a double diamond of private investigation on the webs.
*   recruitment is dead hard and time consuming. I’m trying to remind myself what a privilege it is to be able to build a team around the work that I’m doing, rather than stress myself out with how many applications there are to sift / how many interviews there are to do / how many other things there are to do at the same time.
*   starting therapy again in November, not for any particular reason, more as a bit of a tune up. like new brake pads for the soul. I’ve put a recurring event into my work calendar titled ‘Therapy’ with an hour for travel time afterwards. that’s the kind of _transparent thought leadership_ I am here to provide. no but seriously, maybe it helps to destigmatise the concept of talking to someone. at least for the people who diary stalk me.
*   there are some people I diary stalk quite regularly, and others never. wonder who diary stalks me?
*   [Argentina has the most psychologists per capita in the world](https://qz.com/734450/almost-everyone-in-buenos-aires-is-in-therapy/) and everyone I worked with talked about it quite openly.
*   for months I’ve been planning to move off Tumblr because it’s not 2008 anymore, but who even has the time for that? you’ll see me on a jekyll x netlify stack in about 2024, probably. Taylor Swift is still on Tumblr so at least I’ve got a kindred spirit here.
