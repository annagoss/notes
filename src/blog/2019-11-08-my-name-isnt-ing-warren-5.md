*   at one point this week I had a bit of a breakdown which involved sentences like “I don’t want to be responsible anymore!”. maybe it’s something to do with how much time I’ve spent on the expenses system. no, in reality, I am rational and responsible 94% of the time and I am slowly learning how to be selfish. it’s been tumultuous! no one ever told me that 32 is like 13, but older. is this a thing?
*   this week has felt exceptionally long, and I’ve been into the coffee shop across from the office enough times that they now only make me flat whites with oat milk, even when I want to go rogue and go cow’s milk. I didn’t mean to turn into a regular, I’ve never been a regular in a coffee shop before and I think I want anonymity again.
*   a few times this week I’ve felt that half an hour for a 1:1 meeting is much too short, but 40 minutes would probably have felt alright. why do we divide days up like this? would this still be a problem [if we used Decimal Time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decimal_time)?
*   we did a [With Links on Time](http://links.withassociates.com/themes/time) quite early on, in With Links’ second iteration. I still think about Mathew’s link quite often: Swatch Internet Time. assume Swatch were inspired by the French Revolution, and not sure why a company thought they’d succeed where the people who overturned the French monarchy failed. but ambition is important, right? be selfish, Swatch! don’t hide behind premonitions of failure, you deserve more!
*   on Tuesday I went to my first yoga class in months, and it was restorative yoga: did you know that means lying under a blanket in different positions? exceptionally relaxing but I can’t claim it contributed to my WHO-guidelined 150 minutes of moderate exercise a week.
*   also this week I had lunch with my best friend, who works about 15 minutes from our office. we are going to start having lunch once a week. I’m not sure why we didn’t do that before, but I’m delighted nonetheless.
*   9am is a very civilised time for a pre-work breakfast meeting near the office. I am accepting invitations.
