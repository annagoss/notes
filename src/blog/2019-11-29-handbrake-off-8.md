*   I asked [about sci fi](https://twitter.com/annagoss/status/1199378849303318528) on Twitter earlier in the week. there were so many replies that now I have absolutely no idea of where to start, except for starting with the books that Will brought in for me the very next day. actions speak louder than words IN ACTION!
*   when I was at Co-op I wrote an intro to a story of a food store in 2030 (yes, the most boring story ever) to try to get across how technology was changing retail, and I’m interested in that kind of thing as a design tool more than I’m interested in, as I said on Twitter, spaceships. really hope people haven’t just recommended loads of books about spaceships to me.
*   thought I was being clever today trying to tidy up who I follow on Twitter, to reduce politics and to reduce general noise, because I’ve been sucked right back in recently and I want my brain back again. started a private list, called it ‘mute’ so that I’d remember to mute people later. then Buzz told me he’d got a notification about it. what’s private about that, Twitter? you’ll find me in a shame cave somewhere.
*   yesterday morning I was brushing my hair in front of the mirror, getting ready to leave the house, and started saying in Italian the foods involved in our Italian Christmas lunch. 'involtini, stracchino, manzo, finocchio, funghi, polenta’. what can I say, I’m excited.
*   spent most of therapy this week talking about public loos. I don’t present gender-typically and I pretty much never have, so for most of my life I’ve experienced the odd funny look in women’s loos. somehow over time I’ve translated that into a feeling of guilt that I shouldn’t be there in the first place. it’s stressful! so it was good to talk about it. a reminder for anyone reading that other people in public bathrooms are 100% more likely than you are to know which loo they should be in, and are about as likely as you are to have made a mistake about which door to go through.
*   involved in my fifth recruitment campaign since September, three of which I’ve been the chair for. always write a cover letter!
*   keep being exceptionally un-[Checksies](http://checksies.com/) and checked my portfolio a bunch of times because I’m close to a number that I’m excited about. [this Monevator article](https://monevator.com/how-i-trick-myself-into-achieving-financial-independence/) is a whole set of good reasons Not To Check…but also to pay attention to milestones. after some chat with Rod where we worked out a bunch of ways I could cheat my usual measures and actually be at this milestone (including: “what if I sell loads of stuff on eBay in December so I have an extra £600 to put into Vanguard this month?”), we concluded that it’s all well and good to want to hit targets and so on, but ultimately, stick with good habits, pat self on the back, carry on. yes! it’s the obvious conclusion: do nothing jazzy, keep going.
*   omg Freddie Ljungberg
*   [excellent piece on growth loops shared by Tanya Cordrey](https://twitter.com/tcordrey/status/1200457556843474944), yes I’m linking to the tweet not to the post for proper attribution. it’s easy to lose sight / track of techniques used to build and think about product development from inside govt, because…well, it’s different, innit?
*   the hidden insight this week (which I’ve only found through writing this) is around compulsive checking of things: portfolios, feeds, Arsenal news. might turn my phone off. bye!
