*   [Jack](https://twitter.com/madebysheppard/status/1201245757975732227) tweeted earlier in the week about feeling at a bit of a dead end, and how do you find a mentor etc etc. I’ve definitely felt similarly in recent months: something about getting to a certain level of seniority has meant fewer people looking out for me, and I’ve found myself feeling a bit jealous of the people I line manage or mentor. I want an hour to talk about my work and where I’m going! so I’m accepting offers from people of a service/systems design and product flavour. I’m also still accepting breakfast meetings near the office at 9am!
*   had dinner at [Emile](https://www.emilerestaurant.co.uk/) on Tuesday with some Gail’s pals. it was delicious, especially the pink fir potatoes with anchovy. and the Lancashire poacher croquettes with a brown sauce vibe going on too (cuts through the cheese, innit). I am definitely richer now that I don’t work in food and don’t go out for dinner all the time. but I also definitely eat less delicious food.
*   on Monday I went to a thing about systemic design at the Design Council. it was good, though some examples I was maybe a bit sceptical about. or maybe it’s language. some things can be products or campaigns rather than examples of systems change and that is OK. or maybe everything is systems change when you look at it through a certain lens.
*   when I start on this theoretical stuff, I very quickly get to a place of “I’m tired”. no idea how people can spend their lives so earnestly engaging with it to be honest - I really admire it, but almost immediately get to a place of “what if we all just went to the pub and had a chat?”. I’d like to be one of the earnest engagers, but…well, I’m not / I can’t right now. maybe it’s to do with the work I’ve been doing rather than me. one to consider more in 2020.
*   started reading Girl, Woman, Other by Bernardine Evaristo before bed last night and holy crap it’s good. resented going to work this morning because how DARE work take me from my novel? can’t wait to get on the tube to read more of it and will be devastated when it’s over. I read fiction really fast so it will probably be over by the time I get home :(
*   I know of at least two people at GDS who _used_ to work in publishing and sometimes I’m like, why used to? what was wrong with reading novels all the time? can I have a go?
*   worked from home yesterday. I’m often not very good at working from home, because I don’t take breaks and then my brain burns out a bit. but yesterday was good, I got a whole bunch done. maybe this is because I didn’t want to turn the heating on, so I got a yoga mat out and did a bunch of jumping around for 5 mins every time I got cold. after lunch I went for a 12 minute run before a meeting. get buff, save money, work from home!
