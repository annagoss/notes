*   Philip Pullman was always better than JK Rowling anyway
*   more on transactions, aka the two things I’d forgotten when I wrote about library fees last week: at With Associates, we ate lunch with each other quite often. Mathew had built the table to accommodate that. one person would say “Turkish?” and usually one or two people would go out to get lunch for the others. which meant we all owed each other money quite often. 54Bank (the studio we were in was called 54B) was Mathew’s solution for that. just a simple tally system on a web app, “Anna owes Mathew £6 for Turkish”. and over time, ideally it evens out, or you can call in your debts. I think when we closed I owed about £20 to various people, which was nothing on my unnamed but no less lovely colleague who owed Mathew over 100 quid.
*   upstairs at 54B Tim rented a desk. him and Henry used to have a token system - physical tokens - they had a limited number of physical tokens which were originally shared out evenly. hand over a token to the person buying lunch. when you run out of tokens you know it’s your turn to start buying lunch.
*   Taylor Swift is headlining Glastonbury. I haven’t been for years but it used to be my favourite festival. going to ask the three people I still know working in music if there are any tickets floating around cos MATE wouldn’t that be brilliant! a mere 15 years since my first Glastonbury, which involved an off-site party with the Magic Numbers where I bumped into a girl I fancied from school who’d just won Make Me A Supermodel on telly. being 17 was kind of brilliant sometimes.
*   last night C suggested I do a PhD in comparative pop music focusing on TSwift between 2014-2017 and while I’ve never thought of myself as a PhD person, it does sound tempting.
*   went to Paris for a meeting on Wednesday. you may have seen the news that most of Paris is on strike. I love the French fondness for industrial action - it’s so French! and their revolution was definitely more effective than ours - but spending 3.5h either waiting for or in taxis was not really my idea of a fun day out. at least the meeting went well.
*   started wondering about whether I should get a new New Yorker subscription next year. probably requires reducing my work hours so I actually have time to read it.
*   this week has been full on. I’m very ready to not go to work for a couple of weeks.
