*   what was last Friday? should I write as if it was then or as if it’s now?
*   the people who write weeknotes during the Christmas holidays are my people. well done everyone.
*   went to see my mum and dad pre-Christmas, then from there to Italy to see C’s dad. Christmas day was 9 Italian adults and 4 Italian children and me. I tried my hardest to keep up, but I was glad to be sent to the sofa for a little post-lunch nap. immersion is exhausting!
*   every time I go there I feel like I’ve not made any progress with Italian because there is still so much I don’t understand. but of course I have, and the words I find myself noticing are more advanced every time (this time: essere (to be) and volere (to want) in the present conditional tense!). seriously though, I just want to be fluent!
*   I’m never going to northern Italy without walking boots again.
*   Italian food is, on a day to day basis, far better than English food. even supermarket fruit and veg aisles are an inspiration. but I did find myself missing roast potatoes on Christmas Day.
*   more food: while there, we made pasta (some pappardelle, and C made [casoncelli](https://www.google.com/search?biw=1107&bih=565&sxsrf=ACYBGNTDqWBbXQQ-G1AyoCI5NmE0RBwqXg%3A1577805161558&ei=aWULXuzYIZPrxgOYs72YCQ&q=casoncelli&oq=casoncelli&gs_l=psy-ab.3..0l10.17287.21831..22173...2.4..0.110.975.10j2......0....1..gws-wiz.......0i71j35i39j0i273j0i67j0i131j0i10.ZVB_4vycEdw&ved=0ahUKEwissbehluDmAhWTtXEKHZhZD5MQ4dUDCAs&uact=5)), ragù, veal with fennel and shallots. Christmas Day was polenta and rabbit. so. Italian food is better than English food.
*   everyone on the internet seems to be talking about their years and the last decade and all I’ve managed is to work out who I was going out with in 2009 and that I was three months into my second year of university. so. yes, a lot has changed in 10 years.
*   haven’t decided when to go back to work yet. I have to go back to work?
