*   I had no idea whether to write a weeknote last Friday or not because I’d already posted two that week.
*   had a great dream on Saturday night that, one way or another, Max and I ended up hiring a Zipcar and driving Taylor Swift to her gig in Glasgow. the best part was probably the bit where I dreamt about how we’d taken the Zipcar for longer than we’d expected, but the limit for Flex rentals is £72 / day and we could probably get Universal to pay for it.
*   [Alice](https://alicebartlett.co.uk/) wrote about my weeknote in her weeknote so now I’m going to write about her weeknote in mine. which is to say, I’m glad that the reflexive pronoun misuse resonated with someone else, and this is the internet I love: loosely connected humans making new connections over shared interests (…or frustrations, either is fine). Alice and I have not met to the best of my knowledge, but \[creep alert\] I think I might’ve seen you in Beckenham Park one day in the autumn!
*   first week back at work. I was not ready.
*   maybe also not ready were the multiple cafes that have been, in my humble opinion, fucking with me this week. not open until Wednesday, says the sign on the door. opening at 9.30am instead of the Google Maps prescribed 8am. closed today for maintenance. I have empathy - guess who used to update the Gail’s _Artisan_ Bakery Christmas hours on the internet? - but also, I really wanted a coffee yesterday morning and I was sad.
*   went to [Turncoats](http://turncoats.world/london) last night thanks to a heads up from one of our team. a discussion about the nuclear family home. they said not to tweet about it and I guess that extends to blogging, but how about I refrain from a summary of the discussion and instead list some takeaways: architects look a lot like designers. the live art at the beginning was like something [Sam Trotman](http://www.ssw.org.uk/about/) might’ve taken me to in 2009. the people whose points of view resonated with me the most were, I think, also the people who hated public speaking the most.
*   just had lunch with [Rod](https://twitter.com/rod) who is a delight and I don’t see him enough. we talked mostly about the minefield that is ethical investing. I had a jacket potato.
*   once Christmas credit cards and small stacks of books by the bedside are done, I’m going to get myself a [Daunt Books subscription](https://dauntbooks.co.uk/shop/gifts/daunt-books-subscription/) as a treat. look at that website. it’s so calm. don’t you wish you were in the gallery or sat in one of those wicker chairs?
*   on which: to get through that bedside stack, and reward myself with the treat of someone else choosing things for me, I have some reading to do. this is good also because reading makes me calmer. so consider this me signing out of Twitter for the foreseeable. you’ll find me reading novels and my RSS feeds. weeknotes will continue but I won’t be tweeting them. you can [subscribe to tumblr via RSS](https://notes.annagoss.co/rss) which is great cos I haven’t got round to the ‘replatform my blog’ part of my 2020 OKRs yet. ok bye!
