*   skipped last week. wrote something. didn’t publish it. Friday was busy. have you done your tax return?
*   more travelling this week. have a feeling I’m not meant to write about where I was. how shady is that?
*   good trip though. met lots of nice people. ate a lot of nice food. had some great feedback at the end of the week. as someone who thrives off appreciation, that’ll keep me going for a week or two.
*   in every country I’ve been to, engineering and technical skills have been highly valued by people in government. and talking about transforming government and user needs has also been, mostly, bang on. but I’ve not seen much by way of ‘we need design’. there’s huge potential for design in government around the world.
*   a bunch of people stuff we’ve been working on at GDS in the design team has finally come together this week. the bureaucracy of organising progression in the civil service been wearing me down for months to be honest, but it’s fully gratifying in the end to see good people getting promotions.
*   I know why process exists, but it doesn’t half feel like it detracts from doing valuable work a lot of the time. slowing down good outcomes just a bit.too.much.
*   will be trying out my [Sleepy Ride footrest](https://www.thestrategist.co.uk/article/sleepy-ride-airplane-footrest-review.html) on the flight home tonight. one day you’ll all have one! if it’s good. feedback to follow.
*   haven’t looked at Twitter for two weeks.
*   happy to confirm that [Alice](https://alicebartlett.co.uk/blog/weaknotes-72) was not doing anything embarrassing in Beckenham Park Place when I saw her. maybe when the water in the lake there warms up a bit I’ll be back in that park for a swim and our paths will cross again!
*   three hours till we go to the airport. hotel swim here I come.
*   taking a couple of days off next week. excited to gallivant around London like I used to back in [GoodBooks days](https://www.discogs.com/artist/5812012-Anna-Goss).
*   omg I have a page on Discogs for being a manager!
