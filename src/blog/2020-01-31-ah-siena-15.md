*   turns out gallivanting round London when you’re still a bit jetlagged is actually exhausting.
*   went to Daunt Books for [an event with Hisham Matar](https://dauntbooks.co.uk/shop/events/hisham-matar/) on Wednesday night. the first time I went to Daunt I was a child and it was my [schoolfriend’s mum’s book launch](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Bigstuff-Goddess-Charm-Fiona-Ledger/dp/0330374370/ref=sr_1_2?qid=1580399336&refinements=p_27%3AFiona+Ledger&s=books&sr=1-2) (yes, she worked for the BBC, yes, I grew up in north London). I remember gawping at the gallery and thinking I was in some kind of bookshop heaven. still feels the same way now, to be honest. more of that kind of thing this year!
*   I’d like to spend a month in Siena.
*   Matt Edgar wrote a good post about what he’s [learned delivering digital services](https://blog.mattedgar.com/2020/01/27/delivering-digital-service-this-much-i-have-learned/). I don’t disagree with any of it.
*   a few years after Columbia Records’ copyright expired, GoodBooks have started putting [Control on Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/5OE6sbhumMRzdJ5knClhhr?si=spDeDI4mQROjzV_a-0yaQA). dripfeeding a song a month, so it’ll all be there by the end of the year. still very proud of the record, the band and the few years of my life when I managed them. did I mention that I discovered I have a page on Discogs?
*   this week I mostly prioritised a rapid turnaround of my expenses.
