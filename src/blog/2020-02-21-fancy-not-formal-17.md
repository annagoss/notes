*   this is another weeknote written from an airport. Zagreb airport is excellent.
*   stayed in both a 4\* and a 3\* hotel this week. the 4\* hotel had a pool, but also my room was a bit dark, 25 degrees and couldn’t be made cooler, and confusing shower controls. the 3\* hotel did not have a pool or a spa, but did have good lighting and daylight, was only 21 degrees aka a temperature you can sleep in, and exceptionally clear shower controls. a reminder that stars are given pretty much [on the basis of the features of a hotel](https://www.which.co.uk/reviews/uk-hotel-chains/article/hotel-star-ratings-explained), not necessarily the quality of experience.
*   took too many books with me this week.
*   might’ve sussed out why I might owe some tax. still not sure if I actually owe any tax. tune in next week for more!
*   downloaded Reeder for both mobile and desktop to bring together my RSS and Instapaper in one place. it’s pleasing, and one step on for my 2020 personal stack improvements.
*   really, really, deeply hoping for at least a month at home.
*   the artists formerly known as Poplar have come out of hiding and renamed to [Breakroom](https://www.breakroom.cc/en-gb/employers/coop-food). it’s basically Glassdoor for frontline jobs. more transparency for non white collar workers is a good thing. given they’re building a product that appears to be, essentially, about empowerment, I wonder if a new category could get added…‘This employer is supportive of workers joining a trade union’
*   I haven’t yet worked out the boundaries for working in the open in my current role, so while there is loads I could write about my working week, I am only going to say that political structures of countries can make it really hard to deliver good digital stuff. any hand wringing done about the political system in the UK is obviously not in vain (I’m not a proponent of the “eat your greens, they’re starving in Africa” argument), but damn, we are in many ways very lucky - and we have a lot to learn from those who have more political barriers in place.
*   have now watched the Taylor Swift documentary. probably not for the last time.
