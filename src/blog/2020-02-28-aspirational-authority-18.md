*   I’ve had two nightmares about getting on planes. hugely excited to stay grounded for at least another week after working out last Friday that I’ve been in flight for over 60 hours in the past month. that’s before hanging around in airports or getting to them. the [flygskam](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-51067440) is strong.
*   things that I have read and enjoyed this week include ’[Garbage Language / why do corporations speak the way they do?](https://www.vulture.com/amp/2020/02/spread-of-corporate-speak.html)’ shared by [Ella](https://twitter.com/fitzsimple). best sentence: “The primary unit of meaning was the abstract metaphor.”
*   also the White Pube on [supporting arts inclusivity when you’re privileged](https://www.dazeddigital.com/art-photography/article/48017/1/the-white-pube-on-supporting-arts-inclusivity-when-youre-privileged). “something i’ve said before but worth repeating: ‘ask yourself how much you want the world to progress vs. how much you want to be SEEN as someone who wants the world to progress.’ It shouldn’t be about you and you know that. It should be about our generation as a collective and pulling each other up so we can dismantle the whole thing n start it again but better.”
*   talked to a friend about work this week who said to me “remember what \[friend\] said to me a few years ago: you’re not Jesus.” I mentioned this to my therapist and I have never seen someone try so hard to suppress laughter.
*   time in the market over timing the market, people. a guy on the overground this morning had a mask, a scarf around the mask, and disposable gloves on. I am not that person, but somehow I have taken on coronavirus paranoia enough that I’m trying to stop touching my face. it’s really hard!
*   Arsenal, though. why do we even. it’s the hope that kills you, etc.
*   I’ve never cracked the wallet / purse problem. I prefer to carry things in my pockets rather than in a bag, but carrying individual cards and change loose feels like a falling-out-of-pocket disaster waiting to happen. as of last week I am now putting an elastic band around the cards I carry. it’s minimalist genius, I’ve been laughed at at least twice for it, and it was all C’s idea anyway. come at me haters, it’s only one branded elastic band and an Instagram ad away from commercial riches.
*   restarted Italian lessons after a few months off while my teacher brought up a child. she’s pleased that I appear to be better at Italian than when we left off. that’s all thanks to Duolingo and speaking Italian more at home. turns out practice works!
