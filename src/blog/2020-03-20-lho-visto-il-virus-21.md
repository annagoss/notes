*   well, what a mad week to join GOV.UK.
*   the past five days been a combination of finding my place, figuring out GOV.UK, remembering how to deliver, not putting my back out, learning how to work remotely. and probably something else too.
*   it feels like it’s been a very long week. as predicted, it has been great working with the design team. and everyone else! there’s been loads to get my head around and things have shifted multiple times. the team shipped a new version of [/coronavirus](https://www.gov.uk/coronavirus) today which has come together exceptionally fast.
*   made a prototype today for a service we’ll be likely launching early next week. deeply grateful to [Tim](https://twitter.com/timpaul) who batted back and forth on screen layouts and flows with me. Mum, I’m an interaction designer now!
*   we both have sore throats, so I guess I’m not going out for 7 days, at least. probably inevitable given that C works for the NHS. hopefully it doesn’t get any worse. not sure why I’m not more worried.
*   most of my health complaints this week have been about my back: our flat was not built for home offices. lots of lying on the floor, planking between meetings, and 15 min yoga videos.
*   few of us went to ‘the pub’ on Google Hangouts last night. gonna do it every week.
*   this is mad weird. I’m glad to have been busy because I think I’d be going mad otherwise.
*   [Sonia](http://soniaturcotte.com/) dropped a loaf of bread round. a proper drop off: brown paper bag at the bottom of the stairs. thank you Sonia! I’m having toast for my dinner.
