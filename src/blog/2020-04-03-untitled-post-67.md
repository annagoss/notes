*   enjoyed the occasional chat this week about what’s “right” with regards to the acquisition of stuff. all kinds of stuff. food. other stuff. [this article in the New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/26/style/coronavirus-shopping.html) ends with the line “Sometimes a fleece is only a fleece. And sometimes it can be a creative rescue line, and a bet on the future.” but do I want all those warehouse workers and delivery drivers being out in the world or would I rather they stayed at home? and is it alright that I’m having what a friend called ‘the boujiest pandemic’ by mostly doing Natoora orders and occasionally visiting Jones of Brockley for bread and radicchio? in my head I’m keeping supermarkets free for people who need them, and supporting smaller suppliers. in reality, maybe I just really like expensive rhubarb and Neal’s Yard cheese.
*   most of the ads I get on Instagram now are for fruit and veg wholesalers who have become retailers. the algorithm knows.
*   accompanied C on her ride to the hospital this morning then rode back home before starting work. really not sure why we’ve allowed construction workers to still be out there, cos no one’s keeping 2m apart. roads are decently quiet!
*   work has been less intense this week and there were points that I felt like I was designing something in a vacuum, a little blind of policy intent, user need or GOV.UK’s position in the wider ecosystem. that’s a potential problem with working at this kind of pace and with this much going on. I was happy to end the week with a thumbs up on the work and I think we’ve now got a way forward, so I’m expecting to be shipping a second thing in 4 weeks next week. I am enjoying being close to shipping products and services again: very much my comfort zone, even on a national government website in a crisis.
*   I took my Surly Straggler frame and wheels to Brixton Cycles a while ago and sat with Lincoln there to order all the other bits. on Saturday last week it was ready to go! so we used our government mandated walk to go there and pick it up. it is a nice bike. I am very, very happy with it.
*   in a mad good mood today for some reason. probably the hour’s ride first thing. maybe the work. maybe the beer delivery from [waterintobeer](https://waterintobeer.co.uk/) (thanks Tim, thanks Helen!). maybe just getting used to the indoor life. just a strange feeling of contentment. weird.
