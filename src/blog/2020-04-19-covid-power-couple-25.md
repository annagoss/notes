*   fell off my bike on the way back from the shops on Friday morning. clipped a bin and came off sideways on a route I’ve done probably 150-200 times. there are bruises, no skin was broken, I only cried ten hours later after C got home and was nice to me.
*   arnica is helping.
*   started doing the [Running Clinic’s 5k programme](https://therunningclinic.com/runners/training-programs/) last week. jumped straight into the end of week 6. so until Friday my mind was entirely thinking about intervals and the next run. dead annoying to have to skip a couple of days!
*   C’s days at work are getting longer. I am not above saying that I find 12-14 hours home alone challenging. big love to the people who live on their own.
*   the long weekend was excellent, but can I remember what happened? like hell I can.
*   long chat with Iso this morning, partly around the ‘hero’ narrative for NHS workers. they’re not heroes, they’re skilled workers we should be grateful for and we should pay and reward properly. the moment people become heroes is the moment they can also become martyrs.
*   I think the only work news is that I’m staying on GOV.UK as lead designer indefinitely now and won’t be going back to international even after coronavirus stops making work a bit crazy. happy to carry on working with [Stephen](https://twitter.com/loft27design) and the rest of the crew.
*   started thinking about this whole 'what does the world look like after coronavirus’, the narrative around “we can’t go back to the Before”. the trouble is, as far as I can tell anyway, the way things have been (and continue to be, let’s be real) structured is as a result of power, money, and comfort. so when I buy that coffee off someone who earns less than a proper London living wage, I’m doing that for my own comfort, and I’m still part of the exploitation. how do we reimagine power structures when it causes people discomfort to give up some of the comfort they have? I’m not entirely convinced that enough people are willing to do that. (I mean, one argument is that some people have more money than there is comfort to buy and won’t feel it anyway)
*   anyway, if we could reimagine the world, then thoughts around being less influenced by Europe / US - how do we get a media that properly references the whole world? I want to read about Argentina and Colombia and Nigeria and the Pacific Islands as much as I want to read about Germany and the US, please: equity of coverage hopefully leading to a bit of diversity of thought.
*   if the economy needs rebuilding and economic stimulus and all those things, could we rebuild it in a green way? build cities for pedestrians and bikes (so tempted to buy [two of these](https://www.frontyardcompany.co.uk/products/plantlock) and put them in the middle of our road early one morning to create my own car free street), tax breaks for investments in renewables, ummm other things that would help also welcome.
*   finally and related to the last point: just went for a walk around the grounds of Dulwich College, which have been opened up to the public for the time being. it’s huge! bigger than Dulwich Park! not to mention the attached golf course. how about we share that kind of land more often than just a once-in-a-lifetime (I hope) global pandemic, huh?
