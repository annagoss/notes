*   despite having taken three days off the week before last, I remain very much at the end of my tether. I know this because I spend a lot of time muttering stuff under my breath and swearing when very minor things go wrong.
*   by Wednesday night I was texting pictures of the cheese in the fridge to the group chat after our Sainsbury’s order arrived. by Thursday morning we’d moved onto discussing bin collections. life is truly scintillating right now.
*   bought a turbo trainer a couple of weeks ago. tried to put my bike on it. only then realised - and I should’ve thought about this beforehand - that turbos work best for bikes with vertical dropouts, not my semi-horizontal ones, because lining up cassette and chain is…tricky. any excuse to buy another bike I guess.
*   [like Chris](https://www.thomaschris.co.uk/notes/2021/02/06/weeknote.html), I’m also interested in the search results for ‘garden shelter lean to’. the tree surgeons came on Friday, so now not only is our garden much lighter, but we also have logs to dry out. and as if I’m going to spend £160 on a wood store.
*   feel like I spend most of my spare time at the moment, and occasionally time in working hours, doing wifi network admin. I miss the days of broken internet during working hours being someone else’s problem. and have you ever tried to get a robot vacuum cleaner to connect to a mesh network? a world of pain.
*   finished Broken April by Kadare, a book about people in the Albanian mountains living by a code called the Kanun, which involves generations-long blood feuds between families. I don’t think I understood the ending, but bravo to Daunt Books (my mum bought me a subscription for Christmas), who absolutely nailed the brief of “I want to read things about utopias and dystopias and also the Western Balkans”.
*   the dog has discovered how much she loves chasing squirrels; so much for the easiest dog ever. let the hard training yards begin.
