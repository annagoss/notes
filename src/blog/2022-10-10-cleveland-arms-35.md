*   went for a beer with [Alice](https://www.alicebartlett.co.uk) and suggested I might write a weeknote when I got home
*   we each had two pints of Neck Oil. it was £6.30 for one pint. I’m glad I don’t go to the pub three or four nights a week any more
*   last night our next door neighbour said to me, “there’s a house round the corner, they’ve taken the whole roof off. shall we go round with the cargo bike and see if we can get some wood?”. so we did. I had a head torch. felt like a robber.
*   is it robbing if it’s in a skip?
*   wrapped Pepsi up in a blanket in the cargo bike this evening, cos it was gloves weather for me, and she can’t tell me if she’s cold or not, can she?
*   every day I enjoy being part of the anti-growth coalition just a little bit more.
*   C bought me one of those Ooni pizza ovens for my birthday last week so now I can be anti-growth while I eat pizza in the back garden, fuelled by the wood from the house round the corner’s roof. I wonder how many pizzas it takes, if you consider each pizza as one that isn’t ordered from a takeaway, but also the cost of the pizza oven, to get to a place where it’s actively damaging the economy?
*   suppose this is only true if I don’t spend my money on other things. guess what: it’s all going on buying different types of insulation.
