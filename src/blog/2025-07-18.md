* I _have_ blogged since 2022 but [elsewhere](https://words.ff.studio/time-is-a-material)
* like everyone who has every written a blog post or weeknote, I convinced myself that the platform was the issue, not the...not writing. it didn’t take very long to write a script to export Tumblr posts to Markdown, or to create an Eleventy site. file under ‘things that would not have happened before LLMs’.
* nonetheless my position on ‘owned’ digital services has only become more extreme in recent years, I continue to resent how Medium tries to hijack my habit of selecting text as I read, [Substack is full of Nazis](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/11/substack-extremism-nazi-white-supremacy-newsletters/676156/), [Instagram shadow bans Gaza content](https://themarkup.org/automated-censorship/2024/02/25/how-we-investigated-shadowbanning-on-instagram). in 2006 I attempted to negotiate for GoodBooks to own their own mailing list, not Sony (it did not work). here’s my tiny Markdown-files-held-locally protest, 19 years later!
* did nursery drop off this morning. his face crumpled as he realised I was leaving. ouch.
* things keep costing money: vet bills (she’s fine), parking fines (I ran for a train and forgot), Italian lessons (gotta get that citizenship B1 exam passed or I’ll be the only non-European out of the three of us, even the dog has a European passport). I keep imagining that Things will stop happening, but they never do.
* work is quiet, keeping up momentum on what there is while acknowledging and perhaps even enjoying the quiet is something I find challenging. I’m reading [Not Working by Josh Cohen](https://joshcohenwriter.co.uk/book/not-working-why-we-have-to-stop/) to help me come to terms with my inner slacker and-or slob.
* haven’t yet read [this by James Plunkett](https://medium.com/@jamestplunkett/how-to-save-bureaucracy-from-itself-804957a85e44) but everyone else I’ve seemingly ever met has, so if you haven’t maybe you’d enjoy it too.
* more interested in reading Patricia Highsmith novels at the moment to be honest. [she sounds from this like an absolute dragon](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2025/jul/10/my-harrowing-time-as-patricia-highsmith-assistant) but what a writer!
