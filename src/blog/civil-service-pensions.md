Civil Service (CS) Pensions are quite complicated. I tried to figure them out, made a presentation which I shared with the GDS design team, and made a spreadsheet to work out if I'll be rich when I'm old. I've been told that other people would find all this useful, so here goes nothing.

There are lots of numbers and options thrown around with the CS Pension scheme. When I did a bit of digging, all those numbers got more complicated rather than more simple. So I dug more, talked to some people (thanks [Chris](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chris-heathcote-7a5621/), thanks [Will](https://www.myddelton.co.uk/), thanks [Jen](https://jenniferallum.info/), called the CS Pensions phoneline a few times, and decided I now understood enough that I could try to make it simple.

If you work for the Civil Service and you’re interested in pensions, then:

1. [Here is the presentation I did on Civil Service Pensions (it’s definitely Not Financial Advice)](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1nnvQfkdL1WSj0Q7GTVD54exe8nQ2W3hvvjLJZbsfOHE/edit#slide=id.g10d42026b8_2_0)

2. If you want to play around with numbers, [you can copy this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14PVM6n_Cq6b-G-Bf9GwvKvK8P6rNcWr0XGZLV341uj4/edit#gid=0) and see what comes out. (Thanks [Rod](https://www.holdfastprojects.com/) for the help, I love making spreadsheets with you ❤️)
    
I hope this helps someone out.
