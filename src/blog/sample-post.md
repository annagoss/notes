# Welcome to My Blog

This is a sample blog post to demonstrate the new blog template. The design is clean and minimal, inspired by the aesthetic of annagoss.co.

## Features of This Template

- **Responsive design** that works across all screen sizes
- **Clean typography** using system fonts
- **Dark mode support** that respects user preferences
- **Minimal styling** focused on readability

## Code Examples

Here's some inline `code` and a code block:

```javascript
function greet(name) {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
}

greet('World');
```

## Lists Work Too

- Item one
- Item two
- Item three

And numbered lists:

1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item

The template includes proper spacing, clean typography, and a responsive layout that looks great on both desktop and mobile devices.
