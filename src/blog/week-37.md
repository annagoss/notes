* Five weeks of pretty much consistently 3 days a week at the gym except for one week where I only made it once. This is the consistency I dream of!
* I’m running [GZCLP](https://thefitness.wiki/routines/gzclp/) while I attempt to get some numbers back to where they used to be. the mix of high reps and low reps of the same exercise on different days seems to be serving me well: my bench press has never been so good. Or is it carrying around 12kg of baby that contributes so much to the gainz?
* Giles kindly highlighted FF Studio’s work on his new [Doing Open](https://gilest.org/doingopen/) page. Thank you Giles.
* Temperatures, teething and colds all week. The little guy has suffered, we have suffered marginally less.
* Almost forgot to pay the taxes I’m meant to pay by end of July and cashed out some premium bonds juuust in time. If you also owe tax: you’ve got till Thursday, get on it!
* Got introduced to the concept of [psychic numbing](https://thegoldenhour.substack.com/p/the-inverse-of-awe?r=58d&triedRedirect=true) and it made me feel marginally better. Deep breath, go again, the world is awful but we’re the lucky ones.
* Went to the pick-your-own farm near Worthing on Sunday. Sweetcorn and plums, no raspberries to speak of. Gotta get there on a Friday for raspberries I reckon, before the weekend pickers nab them all.
