[Notes](https://notes.annagoss.co) â€¢ [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/annagoss)

I run [FF Studio](https://www.ff.studio), a service design and technology practice. 
We work with an emerging generation of leaders building organisations fit for the 21st century.

I've worked with the [Premier League](https://www.premierleague.com/), the British Library, the Open University, the [Government Digital Service](https://gds.blog.gov.uk/), [Sainsbury's](http://www.sainsburys.co.uk), [Allstate](http://www.allstate.com), [Soho House](http://2014.withassociates.com/projects/soho-house), [Resonance FM](http://www.resonancefm.com), Barclays, [Dot Everyone](http://www.doteveryone.org), Sony Music, and Wichita Recordings.

Previously lead service designer at GDS on GOV.UK and GOV.UK Verify, product manager at [Co-op Digital](https://digitalblog.coop.co.uk), [Pivotal Labs](https://pivotal.io/labs), and senior producer at [With Associates](http://2016.withassociates.com). Before working in digital, I worked in the music industry managing bands signed to major and independent labels.

In my spare time, [I write a newsletter about how money works](http://www.checksies.com), jazz about with my dog Pepsi in the South Downs, and swim in the sea at Hove Beach.
